## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a novel deep learning approach for volumetric tractography segmentation using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The method transforms streamline representations into volumetric density maps and employs a specialized architecture to effectively capture the spatial relationships between different white matter tracts.

## Research Context

Tractography is a technique that allows the reconstruction of white matter tracts from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). It provides valuable insights into the structural connectivity of the brain, which is essential for understanding both normal brain function and neurological disorders.

The segmentation of these tracts is a challenging task due to their complex three-dimensional structure and the variability in brain anatomy across individuals. Traditional segmentation methods often rely on manual or semi-automatic approaches, which are time-consuming, subjective, and not scalable for large datasets.

## Our Approach

### Volumetric Representation

Instead of working directly with the streamline representation of tractography data, we convert the tracts into volumetric density maps. This transformation allows us to:

1. Leverage the power of 3D CNNs, which have shown remarkable success in medical image segmentation
2. Capture the spatial context of each fiber tract within the brain
3. Create a representation that is more amenable to deep learning techniques

### 3D CNN Architecture

We developed a specialized 3D CNN architecture that consists of:

1. **Encoding Path**: A series of 3D convolutional layers that progressively extract features from the input volume
2. **Decoding Path**: Upsampling layers that restore the spatial resolution while incorporating features from the encoding path
3. **Skip Connections**: Connections between encoding and decoding paths that help preserve spatial information
4. **Attention Gates**: Mechanisms that focus the network's attention on relevant regions of the brain

## Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline involves several steps:

```python
def preprocess_tractography_data(streamlines, reference_image, resolution=1.0):
    """
    Convert streamlines to volumetric representation
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    streamlines : list
        List of streamlines (3D curves representing fiber tracts)
    reference_image : nibabel.Nifti1Image
        Reference MRI image for spatial alignment
    resolution : float
        Voxel resolution in mm
        
    Returns:
    --------
    volume : ndarray
        Volumetric density map
    """
    # Get dimensions and affine transform from reference image
    affine = reference_image.affine
    dimensions = reference_image.shape
    
    # Initialize empty volume
    volume = np.zeros(dimensions)
    
    # Convert each streamline to voxel coordinates and increment volume
    for streamline in streamlines:
        # Transform from world to voxel coordinates
        voxel_coords = np.floor(np.dot(np.linalg.inv(affine), 
                                       np.c_[streamline, np.ones(streamline.shape[0])].T)).T
        voxel_coords = voxel_coords[:, :3].astype(int)
        
        # Keep only coordinates within volume dimensions
        valid_mask = np.all((voxel_coords >= 0) & 
                            (voxel_coords < np.array(dimensions)), axis=1)
        valid_coords = voxel_coords[valid_mask]
        
        # Increment volume at streamline locations
        for x, y, z in valid_coords:
            volume[x, y, z] += 1
    
    # Normalize volume
    if np.max(volume) > 0:
        volume = volume / np.max(volume)
    
    return volume
```

### Network Architecture

The core of our 3D CNN architecture is implemented as follows:

```python
def create_3d_unet(input_shape, n_classes):
    """
    Create a 3D U-Net model for volumetric segmentation
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    input_shape : tuple
        Shape of input volume (depth, height, width, channels)
    n_classes : int
        Number of output classes
        
    Returns:
    --------
    model : tf.keras.Model
        3D U-Net model
    """
    inputs = Input(input_shape)
    
    # Encoding path
    conv1 = Conv3D(32, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(inputs)
    conv1 = Conv3D(32, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv1)
    pool1 = MaxPooling3D(pool_size=(2, 2, 2))(conv1)
    
    conv2 = Conv3D(64, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(pool1)
    conv2 = Conv3D(64, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv2)
    pool2 = MaxPooling3D(pool_size=(2, 2, 2))(conv2)
    
    conv3 = Conv3D(128, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(pool2)
    conv3 = Conv3D(128, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv3)
    pool3 = MaxPooling3D(pool_size=(2, 2, 2))(conv3)
    
    # Bottom level
    conv4 = Conv3D(256, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(pool3)
    conv4 = Conv3D(256, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv4)
    
    # Decoding path with skip connections
    up5 = concatenate([UpSampling3D(size=(2, 2, 2))(conv4), conv3], axis=-1)
    conv5 = Conv3D(128, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(up5)
    conv5 = Conv3D(128, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv5)
    
    up6 = concatenate([UpSampling3D(size=(2, 2, 2))(conv5), conv2], axis=-1)
    conv6 = Conv3D(64, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(up6)
    conv6 = Conv3D(64, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv6)
    
    up7 = concatenate([UpSampling3D(size=(2, 2, 2))(conv6), conv1], axis=-1)
    conv7 = Conv3D(32, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(up7)
    conv7 = Conv3D(32, (3, 3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv7)
    
    # Output layer
    outputs = Conv3D(n_classes, (1, 1, 1), activation='softmax')(conv7)
    
    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    return model
```

## Future Work

We're currently exploring several extensions to this work:

1. **Multi-modal Integration**: Combining tractography with other MRI modalities (T1, fMRI) for more comprehensive brain mapping
2. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Developing techniques to estimate the uncertainty in segmentation predictions
3. **Transfer Learning**: Adapting the model to work with limited labeled data through transfer learning approaches
4. **Clinical Validation**: Evaluating the method in clinical settings for neurological applications

This project serves as the foundation for our more recent work on GNN-based tractography segmentation, which builds upon these volumetric approaches while incorporating graph-based representations.
